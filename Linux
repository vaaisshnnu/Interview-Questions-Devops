1. What is the difference between Linux and Unix?

Linux is an open-source Unix-like OS based on the Linux Kernel. Unix is proprietary and developed by AT&T/Bell Labs.

Systemd replaces runlevels with targets (e.g., multi-user.target).

3. How do you check system resource usage?

top, htop – CPU & memory
df -h – disk usage
du -sh – directory size
free -m – memory
iostat, vmstat – performance

4. How do you check which process is using a port?

sudo lsof -i :8080
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 8080
