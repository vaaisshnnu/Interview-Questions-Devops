Very Common DevOps Interview Questions 

1. What is DevOps?
A culture + practices that combine development & operations to deliver applications faster using automation, CI/CD, and collaboration.

2. What is CI/CD?

CI: automated build & test
CD: automated deployment
Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps.

3. What is IaC? Why is it important?

Infrastructure as Code automates server provisioning using code.

Benefits:
Consistency
Easy rollback
Reproducibility
Speed

Tools: Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible.

4. What is Git?
Distributed version control tool to track code changes.

5. What is Git branching strategy?

GitFlow
Feature Branch
Release Branching
Trunk based development

6. What is the difference between Docker and VM?

Docker is lightweight, shares OS kernel.
VMs include full OS.
Docker → faster, low resource.

7. What is Kubernetes?

Container orchestration tool used to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

8. What is a container registry?

A repository for storing Docker images.
Examples: ECR, ACR, Docker Hub.

9. What is a load balancer?

Distributes traffic across servers to improve reliability.

10. What is monitoring vs logging?

Monitoring: metrics (CPU, memory, latency)
Logging: application/system logs

Tools:
Monitoring → Prometheus, CloudWatch
Logging → ELK stack, Fluentd

11. What is blue-green deployment?

Two environments (blue & green) — switch traffic after deployment to avoid downtime.

12. What is canary deployment?

Release features to a small % of users before full rollout.

13. What is Helm?

Package manager for Kubernetes.
Used for templating K8s apps.

14. How do you secure DevOps pipelines?

Secrets in Key Vault
Code scanning
Image scanning (Trivy)
RBAC
TLS/SSL

15. What are artifacts?

Build outputs like .jar, .zip, docker images.

16. What is configuration management?

Managing system state using tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet.

17. What is a service mesh?

Layer for traffic control in microservices.
Examples: Istio, Linkerd.

18. What is horizontal vs vertical scaling?

Horizontal: add more servers
Vertical: increase resources (CPU, RAM)

19. What is API gateway?

Entry point for microservices — handles routing, auth, rate-limiting.
Examples: Kong, Nginx, API Gateway.

20. What is high availability?

Ensuring systems stay up even if components fail using redundancy, load balancing, and replication
