🔵 DOCKER — Interview Questions + Perfect Answers
1. What is the difference between an Image and a Container?

Answer:

Image → A read-only blueprint that contains the application code + dependencies.
Container → A running instance of an image with its own process, filesystem, and configuration.

Simple analogy:
Image = class
Container = object

2. Difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Dockerfile?

Answer:

CMD provides default arguments that can be overridden at runtime.

ENTRYPOINT defines the main command that always executes.

Best practice:
Use ENTRYPOINT for the main executable.
Use CMD for parameters.

3. What are Docker Volumes? Why are they used?

Answer:
Volumes are external storage mechanisms managed by Docker.
They are used for:

Persisting data even when containers are removed

Sharing data between multiple containers

Improving I/O performance

Examples: databases, logs, configs.

4. How do you reduce Docker image size?

Answer:

Use Alpine images

Combine RUN commands

Use multi-stage builds

Avoid installing unnecessary packages

Clean cache in RUN (e.g., yum clean all, rm -rf /var/cache/...)

Use .dockerignore

5. What is a Multi-Stage Build?

Answer:
It allows you to use multiple FROM instructions within a Dockerfile to:

✔ Build the application in one stage
✔ Copy only final artifacts to a lightweight image

Reduces image size drastically.

6. How do you check logs of a Docker container?
docker logs <container_name>


For real-time streaming:

docker logs -f <container_name>

7. A container is stuck in CrashLoopBackOff. What do you do?

Answer:

Check logs

docker logs <container>


Check exit code

docker inspect <container> --format='{{.State.ExitCode}}'


Run container in interactive mode

docker run -it <image> /bin/bash


Check health checks / environment vars

Validate application startup script

8. How do you pass environment variables into a container?

Using -e flag:

docker run -e ENV=prod imagename


Using env file:

docker run --env-file=config.env imagename

9. Difference between Dockerfile COPY vs ADD?

COPY

Copies files/folders from local filesystem

Safer & more predictable

ADD

Can extract TAR files

Can copy from URLs
→ Not recommended unless needed

10. Explain Docker Networking Types.

Bridge (default)

Containers on the same host communicate

Host

Container shares host network namespace

None

No networking

Overlay

Multi-host networking (Swarm/Kubernetes)

11. What is Docker Compose?

Answer:
A YAML-based tool to run multi-container applications.

Benefits:

Define services, networks, volumes

Bring up the entire stack using:

docker-compose up -d


12. How do you troubleshoot a container that won’t start?

Steps:

Check logs

Inspect container

Run container interactively

Check Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT/CMD

Check port availability

Check image builds without errors

Check mounted volume paths
