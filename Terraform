✅ Terraform — Top Interview Questions & Answers

1. What is Terraform and how is it different from other IaC tools like CloudFormation or Ansible?

Answer:
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It provisions and manages infrastructure using declarative configuration files.
Differences:

Terraform vs CloudFormation: CloudFormation is AWS-only; Terraform is multi-cloud.

Terraform vs Ansible: Ansible is configuration management; Terraform handles infrastructure provisioning.

Terraform uses state files to track resources; Ansible is mostly stateless.

2. What is a Terraform state file and why is it important?

Answer:
The state file (terraform.tfstate) stores the mapping between Terraform configuration and real cloud resources.
It is important because:

Terraform uses it to determine what changes to apply.

Helps detect drift.

Required for collaboration.

Remote state enables team access and locking.

3. What is “Terraform Remote State,” and why do we use it?

Answer:
Remote state stores the tfstate file in backend providers such as S3, Azure Blob, GCS, Terraform Cloud, etc.
Benefits:

Enables team collaboration

Prevents conflicts with state locking (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB)

More secure than local storage

Allows state sharing across projects/modules

4. Explain the difference between a Terraform module and a resource.

Answer:

Resource: The smallest building block (e.g., aws_instance, azurerm_vm).

Module: A collection of resources grouped together, reusable and shareable.
Terraform always has a root module, and additional child modules can be created or pulled from the registry.

5. What is the workflow of Terraform (init → plan → apply)?

Answer:

terraform init — Downloads providers & initializes backend

terraform plan — Shows what Terraform will create/change/destroy

terraform apply — Executes changes

terraform destroy — Removes resources created by Terraform

This workflow ensures safe, predictable infrastructure deployments.

6. What are Terraform Providers? How do they work?

Answer:
Providers are plugins that allow Terraform to interact with APIs (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, GitHub, etc.)
They:

Authenticate with the platform

Provide resource types

Translate Terraform commands into API calls
Examples:
aws, azurerm, kubernetes, helm, docker

7. What are Variables & Outputs in Terraform?

Answer:
Variables (variables.tf): Inputs to make configurations dynamic.
Types: string, number, bool, list, map, object.

Outputs (outputs.tf): Display or expose data after apply.
Used for:

Passing values between modules

Displaying resource attributes (e.g., IP address)

8. What is Tainting in Terraform?

Answer:
terraform taint <resource> marks a resource as tainted, forcing Terraform to recreate it during the next apply.
Useful for:

Fixing corrupted resources

Forcing replacement without modifying code

Note: In v0.15+, taint is deprecated in favor of -replace.

9. How does Terraform handle dependencies between resources?

Answer:
Terraform automatically determines dependencies using:

Implicit dependency: References using attributes (recommended)
Example:

instance_id = aws_instance.web.id


Explicit dependency: Using depends_on

depends_on = [aws_vpc.main]


Terraform’s DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) ensures resources are created in the correct order.

10. How do you manage different environments (dev, qa, prod) in Terraform?

Answer:
Common methods:

Workspaces – Keep the same config but different state

Separate folders per environment – Most popular

Modules + variable files
Example:

terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"


Terragrunt – Wrapper for multi-environment automation
