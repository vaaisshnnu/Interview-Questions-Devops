✅ Terraform — Top Interview Questions & Answers

1. What is Terraform and how is it different from other IaC tools like CloudFormation or Ansible?

Answer:
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It provisions and manages infrastructure using declarative configuration files.
Differences:

Terraform vs CloudFormation: CloudFormation is AWS-only; Terraform is multi-cloud.

Terraform vs Ansible: Ansible is configuration management; Terraform handles infrastructure provisioning.

Terraform uses state files to track resources; Ansible is mostly stateless.

2. What is a Terraform state file and why is it important?

Answer:
The state file (terraform.tfstate) stores the mapping between Terraform configuration and real cloud resources.
It is important because:

Terraform uses it to determine what changes to apply.

Helps detect drift.

Required for collaboration.

Remote state enables team access and locking.

3. What is “Terraform Remote State,” and why do we use it?

Answer:
Remote state stores the tfstate file in backend providers such as S3, Azure Blob, GCS, Terraform Cloud, etc.
Benefits:

Enables team collaboration

Prevents conflicts with state locking (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB)

More secure than local storage

Allows state sharing across projects/modules

4. Explain the difference between a Terraform module and a resource.

Answer:

Resource: The smallest building block (e.g., aws_instance, azurerm_vm).

Module: A collection of resources grouped together, reusable and shareable.
Terraform always has a root module, and additional child modules can be created or pulled from the registry.

5. What is the workflow of Terraform (init → plan → apply)?

Answer:

terraform init — Downloads providers & initializes backend

terraform plan — Shows what Terraform will create/change/destroy

terraform apply — Executes changes

terraform destroy — Removes resources created by Terraform

This workflow ensures safe, predictable infrastructure deployments.

6. What are Terraform Providers? How do they work?

Answer:
Providers are plugins that allow Terraform to interact with APIs (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, GitHub, etc.)
They:

Authenticate with the platform

Provide resource types

Translate Terraform commands into API calls
Examples:
aws, azurerm, kubernetes, helm, docker

7. What are Variables & Outputs in Terraform?

Answer:
Variables (variables.tf): Inputs to make configurations dynamic.
Types: string, number, bool, list, map, object.

Outputs (outputs.tf): Display or expose data after apply.
Used for:

Passing values between modules

Displaying resource attributes (e.g., IP address)

8. What is Tainting in Terraform?

Answer:
terraform taint <resource> marks a resource as tainted, forcing Terraform to recreate it during the next apply.
Useful for:

Fixing corrupted resources

Forcing replacement without modifying code

Note: In v0.15+, taint is deprecated in favor of -replace.

9. How does Terraform handle dependencies between resources?

Answer:
Terraform automatically determines dependencies using:

Implicit dependency: References using attributes (recommended)
Example:

instance_id = aws_instance.web.id


Explicit dependency: Using depends_on

depends_on = [aws_vpc.main]


Terraform’s DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) ensures resources are created in the correct order.

10. How do you manage different environments (dev, qa, prod) in Terraform?

Common methods:
Workspaces – Keep the same config but different state
Separate folders per environment – Most popular
Modules + variable files

Example:
terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"
Terragrunt – Wrapper for multi-environment automation

What is Terraform and why is it used?

Answer:
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to provision and manage cloud infrastructure in a declarative manner.
It is used because it is:

Multi-cloud compatible (AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, Kubernetes, etc.)

Supports idempotent deployments

Uses a state file to track actual infrastructure

Enables automation, versioning, repeatability, and consistency

2. What is a Terraform Provider?

Answer:
A provider is a plugin that tells Terraform how to interact with an external service.
Examples:

AWS (hashicorp/aws)

Azure (hashicorp/azurerm)

Kubernetes (hashicorp/kubernetes)

Docker (kreuzwerker/docker)

It handles authentication, API calls, and resource creation.

3. What is a Terraform Module?

Answer:
A module is a reusable collection of Terraform resources.
Types:

Root module – main working directory

Child module – called using module { }

Registry modules – reusable community modules

Modules help maintain clean, DRY, reusable IaC code.

4. Explain Terraform State. Why is it important?

Answer:
terraform.tfstate stores a snapshot of real cloud resources.
It is important because:

Detects what changed

Tracks metadata (IDs, dependencies)

Allows Terraform to plan and apply safely

Needed for collaboration

Never store it in Git.

5. What is Remote State and why do we use it?

Answer:
Remote state stores tfstate on remote services like:

AWS S3 + DynamoDB (locking)

Azure Blob Storage

Terraform Cloud

Google Cloud Storage

Benefits:

Centralized access

State locking

Secure and team-friendly

6. What is Terraform Plan vs Apply?

Answer:

terraform plan: Shows what Terraform will create, modify, or destroy.

terraform apply: Executes the changes.
Plan is read-only; apply changes real infrastructure.

7. How do you handle sensitive values in Terraform?

Answer:

Use sensitive = true in variable definitions

Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.

Use .tfvars files for sensitive inputs

Do NOT commit .tfvars to Git

Use remote backends with encryption

8. What is Terraform Workspace?

Answer:
Workspaces allow multiple states for the same configuration.
Example:

terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new prod


Useful for:

dev/test/prod

multi-tenant deployments

9. What is the difference between count and for_each?

Answer:
count → index-based, good for identical resources
for_each → key-value based, for complex + named resources

Example:

count = 3


vs.

for_each = toset(["dev","stage","prod"])

10. What happens during terraform init?

Answer:
Terraform initializes the working directory by:

Downloading providers

Setting up backend

Installing required modules

Validating the configuration

It must be run before plan and apply.
