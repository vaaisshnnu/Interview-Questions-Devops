🔵 KUBERNETES — Must-Prepare Interview Questions + Perfect Answers 🔵

1. What happens when you run "kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml" ? { This is one of the MOST asked questions } 

Answer:
Client validates the YAML.
Request goes to API Server.
API server stores the object in etcd (cluster database).
Controller Manager detects desired state ≠ actual state.
Deployment Controller creates a ReplicaSet.
ReplicaSet creates Pods.
Scheduler picks nodes.
Kubelet pulls image → creates container.
kube-proxy updates networking rules.
Application becomes available.

2. What is the difference between Deployment, ReplicaSet, and Pod?

Answer:
Pod → Smallest unit, contains containers
ReplicaSet → Ensures number of pod replicas
Deployment → Manages ReplicaSets + rolling updates
Deployment > ReplicaSet > Pod (hierarchy)

3. Explain ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer services.

Answer:
ClusterIP (default) : Internal access only
Used for inter-service communication

NodePort : Exposes service on every node: <NodeIP>:<Port>
Limited to port 30000–32767

LoadBalancer : Provision external LoadBalancer (cloud)
Used for production/public access

4. What is an Ingress and Ingress Controller?

Answer:
Ingress : It's Layer 7 routing which Routes traffic based on host/path and it Reduces need for multiple LoadBalancers
Ingress Controller : Software that processes the rules

Example: NGINX, Traefik, AWS ALB, HAProxy

5. Explain Readiness vs Liveness Probe.

Answer:
Liveness Probe : Checks if container is alive
If failing → K8s restarts the container

Readiness Probe: Checks if container is ready to serve traffic
If failing → Pod removed from service endpoints

6. What is a CrashLoopBackOff? How do you troubleshoot?

Answer:
CrashLoopBackOff = container keeps crashing repeatedly.

Troubleshooting steps:
Check pod logs : kubectl logs <pod> -c <container>
Describe pod   : kubectl describe pod <name>
Check events, wrong env vars, wrong ports
Run pod in debug/safe mode
Check entrypoint/scripts
Check resource limits (OOMKilled is common)

7. Explain ConfigMaps vs Secrets.

ConfigMap
Stores non-sensitive key-value data
Stored unencrypted in etcd

Secret
Stores sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
Base64-encoded
Can be encrypted at rest

Use cases:
ConfigMap → app configs
Secret → DB password, API keys

8. What is a DaemonSet?

A DaemonSet ensures one pod runs on every node.

Use cases:
Node monitoring (Datadog, Prometheus Node Exporter)
Log collectors (Fluentd, Filebeat)
Networking agents (CNI)

9. What is a StatefulSet?

Used for stateful applications requiring:
Stable network IDs
Persistent storage
Ordered scaling
Ordered rolling updates

Examples:
MongoDB
Cassandra
Kafka
Zookeeper

10. What is a Persistent Volume (PV) & PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)?

PV: Actual physical storage in cluster
PVC: Request for storage resources by a pod

Flow:

Application → PVC → PV → Storage class → Cloud storage

11. What is Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?

Automatically scales pods based on:
CPU usage
Memory usage
Custom metrics

Command: kubectl autoscale deployment nginx --min=2 --max=10 --cpu-percent=60

12. Explain Taints and Tolerations.

Used to restrict which pods can schedule on a node.

Taint → Node-level rule

Toleration → Pod-level exception

Example use case:
Dedicated nodes for logging/ML workloads.

13. What is Node Affinity?
Used to attract pods to specific nodes.

Example:
deploy pod only on nodes labeled env=prod.

14. How does the Kubernetes scheduler work?

Scheduler assigns pods to nodes based on:

Node filters (taints, affinity, resources)
Scoring nodes
Choosing best node
Kubelet on that node creates pod

15. How do you upgrade a Kubernetes deployment?
kubectl set image deployment/myapp app=myimage:v2

Or 

update YAML and apply:  kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml


Rollback:
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp

16. What is the difference between kubectl apply vs kubectl create?

create: 
Creates new object only
Fails if object exists

apply
Creates or updates (idempotent)
Best for GitOps / DevOps pipelines

17. What is etcd?

Key-value store
Stores entire cluster state
Very sensitive / critical component

Must be backed up regularly
